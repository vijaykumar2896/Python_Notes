Strings
In python, you can store Strings into a variable by surrounding the text with single quotes or double quotes
Examples:
name = "Arun Motoori"
location = 'Hyderabad'
color = str("black")
Strings work like Collection List in Python
Examples:
print(name[0])
for letter in name:
print(len(name))
print("run" in name)
print("run" not in name)
Slicing Strings
print(name[1:4]) - Index 1 to position 4
print(name[:4]) - Index 0 to position 4
print(name[1:]) - Index 1 to last position
Modifying Strings
print(name.upper())
print(name.lower())
print("   Arun Motoori   ".strip()) - Removing leading and trailing spaces
print(name.replace("n","b"))
print(name.split(" "))
in and not in operator with String
print("run" in "Arun")
Strings are immutable in Python
name = "Arun"
print(id(name))
name = "Motoori"
print(id(name))
Other String functions
name.capitalize() - First letter of the statement will get capitalized
name.title() - First letter of each word in the statement gets capitalized
name.count("word") - returns the number of times the give word is available in the string
a.find("word") - returns index if found, otherwise returns -1
comparing strings in Python
Using ==
Using __eq__() function - a.__eq__(b)
a.casefold() == b (without case comparison)
