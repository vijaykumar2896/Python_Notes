Represents something that belongs to the class
Can be used to access the variables and methods inside the same class
Inside the Class we have to use self to access the properties and outside the class we have to use object reference to access the class properties
self parameter can be renamed
Assigning function parameters to class variables (Will be explained in the next session in detail)
