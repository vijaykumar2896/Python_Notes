File Handling 
Reading data from Files and Writing data into Files using Python.
Opening,Writing and Closing Files
We can open the Files in read only (r), write (w) and appending (a) modes  
file = open("C:\\abc\\xyz.txt","w")
file.write("My name is Arun Motoori \n")
file.write("I am teaching Python Programming")
file.close()


Reading Files
file = open("C:\\abc\\xyz.txt","r")
print(file.read()) - All characters will be read here
print(file.read(15)) - 15 characters will be read here
print(file.readlines()) - Reads all the lines in the list format
print(file.readline()) - Reads line by line but only one line
file.close()


Appending text to existing file content
file = open("C:\\abc\\xyz.txt","a")
file.write("\nPython is an easy programming language")
file.close()
Using for each loop for reading a file
file = open("C:\\abc\\xyz.txt","r")
for line in file:
print(line)
